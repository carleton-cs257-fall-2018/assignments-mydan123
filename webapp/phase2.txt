To get our data we went to:
https://data.worldbank.org/country/
Then, we clicked on each country we were interested in.
On each country's page is a link that says "csv", which gives csv data.
We chose countries in the Middle East.

The dataset for each country includes statistics about:
 - Crime
 - Economic indicators
   - Import/export data
   - Tariff data
   - Infrastructure data
   - Internal economy
 - Health data
   - Smoking

   - Prevalence of certain diseases
   - Per c/apita doctors/nurses
   - Population age
 - Gender equality data
 - Environmental data
