To get our data we went to:
https://data.worldbank.org/country/
Then, we clicked on each country we were interested in.
On each country's page is a link that says "csv", which gives csv data.
We got data from many countries in the Middle East.

The dataset for each country includes statistics about:
 - Crime
 - Economic indicators
   - Import/export data
   - Tariff data
   - Infrastructure data
   - Internal economy
 - Health data
   - Smoking
   - Infant/maternal mortality
   - Prevalence of certain diseases
   - Per capita doctors/nurses
   - Population age
 - Gender equality data
 - Environmental data

Categories we tentativeley are including in our final application:
 - Economic indicators (e.g. debt, GDP, spending, etc.)
 - Health indicators (e.g. infant mortality, life expectancy, etc.)
 - Gender equality (e.g. school enrollment by gender, etc.)
 - Demographic indicators (population age, male/female)
 - Religion data (if we can find some)


User stories:

    in order to understand the economy of Middle Eastern countries.
 2. As a researcher, I need reliable data for each ME country on economics, demographics,
    religion, and gender.

 4. As a civilian, I wasnt access to readable data regarding religion, terrorism, the economy, 
    and demographic info.

    familiarize myself with foreign nations.
